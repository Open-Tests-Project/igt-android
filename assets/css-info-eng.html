At the end of the test (by accessing the menu in the second page of charts), you can save a Csv file. 
<br>
At any time, you can view some charts, uploading the Csv file saved in this web page
(better if you use a tablet or a computer):
<br>
<a href="www.simonesacchi.com/igt-charts/#eng">www.simonesacchi.com/igt-charts/#eng</a>

<br><br>
The data saved are:


<ol>

	<li>the participant's name</li>
	<li>the trial number</li>
	<li>the selected deck</li>
	<li>the reward</li>
	<li>the penalty</li>
	<li>the net gain (reward - penalty)</li>
	<li>the total earned</li>
	<li>the response time (the interval in milliseconds between trials)</li>
	<li>the pressure* put on display (if supported)</li>
	<li>the pressure style** (if supported)</li>
	<li>the touch speed***</li>
	<li>the time</li>
	<li>the date</li>

</ol>

<p>* for each touch, the pressure can be measured in two moments: when the finger begins the contact 
	with the screen and when the finger stops the contact. The data saved is the average of these two values.	
</p>

<p>** this is an experimental measure, each touch can take only three values:
	<ul>
		<li>LOW_HIGH: when the initial pressure is less than the final pressure</li>
		<li>HIGH_LOW: when the initial pressure is greater than the final pressure</li>
		<li>EQUAL: when the two pressures are equal</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>*** for how many milliseconds the finger is in contact with the display
